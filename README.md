### 顺序删除
给定一个顺序存储的线性表，请设计一个函数删除所有值大于min而且小于max的元素。删除后表中剩余元素保持顺序存储，并且相对位置不能改变。  
Given a sequentially stored linear table, design a function to remove all elements whose values are greater than min and less than max. After deletion, the remaining elements in the table are stored sequentially, and their relative positions cannot be changed.

### 链表合并
已知线性表LA和LB的数据元素按值非递减有序排列，现要求将LA和LB归并为一个新的线性表LC，且LC中元素扔按非递减有序排列。  
It is known that the data elements of linear table LA and LB are arranged in non-decreasing order, and it is required to merge LA and LB into a new linear table LC, and the elements in LC are arranged in non-decreasing order.
